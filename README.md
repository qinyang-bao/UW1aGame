UW1aGame - Lots of Memes!

This is a 2D game based on my experience in UW1a built with Unity and #C...it has many memes...hope you enjoy it!

First, it was only intended to build a game for CHE102, but afterwards, I decieded to expand and add games for other courses. 
Currently, MATH116 is in development

NOTE: if you just want to play this game, you only need the "Builds" folder. Open the exectuable file and play :)
